Your desktop is a mess. Admit it. Just like a desk with papers all over, a messy computer desktop is far from productive. Plus, it just doesn't look nice. If you're having issues finding the recycle bin on your desktop, it's probably a sign from the Computer Gods that you need to change things up a bit. This doesn't just mean removing a couple icons here or there, but instead starting with a clean slate...er....desktop.

You might be thinking "but I don't want to download any programs to clean up my desktop". The great thing is you don't have to. All of the following can be done without downloading anything. Although I will make some recommendations later on that will spruce up your desktop even more, they aren't needed --- just helpful.
